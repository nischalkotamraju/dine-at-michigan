## How it Works

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1264b22-d0ad-44e8-9342-ec53ec94d37b"><br>

At the core of the system is a remote **Render** instance, which is scheduled to run every 24 hours at 7:00 AM UTC _(or 1:00 AM CST)_. This instance is responsible for scraping the dining menus from UT Austin, sourced from [this page](https://hf-foodpro.austin.utexas.edu/foodpro/location.aspx). Once the menus are scraped, the data is stored in a **Supabase** database. The web scraper can be found in the [UT Dining Scraper](https://github.com/ethanl06/ut-dining-scraper) repository.

Every 24 hours, the **Expo** mobile application fetches the latest menu data from the database, keeping the application up-to-date. To optimize performance and reduce loading times, the data is cached locally in an **SQLite** database using **Drizzle ORM**. This local cache allows the app to quickly retrieve the necessary information, ensuring a smooth, **offline-first** user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- An iOS or Android emulator. Follow the guide [here](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) to set up an Android emulator or [here](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) for an iOS simulator.

### VSCode Extensions

We recommend using the following VSCode extensions to improve your development experience:

- **[Biome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome)**: For automatic code formatting and linting.
- **[Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)**: For Tailwind CSS class autocomplete and IntelliSense.

### Installation

1. **Fork the Repository**

   Go to the [UT Dining repository](https://github.com/Longhorn-Developers/UT-Dining.git) and click the [Fork](https://github.com/Longhorn-Developers/UT-Dining.git) button in the top-right corner of the page.

   After forking, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ut-dining.git
   cd ut-dining
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
    pnpm install
   ```

3. **Run Local Supabase Instance**

   For this step, you need [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) installed on your machine. Follow the guide to install it on your system.

   Next, install the Supabase CLI. Follow the guide [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started?queryGroups=platform&platform=macos#installing-the-supabase-cli).

   After installing the Supabase CLI, run the following command to start a local Supabase instance:

   ```sh
   supabase start
   ```

   Once it's up and running, you should see a message like this in the terminal:

   ```sh
   Started supabase local development setup.

         API URL: http://localhost:54321
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://localhost:54323
    Inbucket URL: http://localhost:54324
        anon key: eyJh......
   service_role key: eyJh......
   ```

   The `API URL` and `anon key` are the environment variables you need to configure in the next step.

   **Optional (but HIGHLY recommend): Setting up Related Services**

   If you want to work with the complete UT Dining ecosystem, you can also set up:

   - **[UT Dining Scraper](https://github.com/EthanL06/ut-dining-scraper)**: To seed your local Supabase database with menu data, clone the scraper repository in a separate directory and use the same `API_URL` and `anon key` from your local Supabase instance in the `.env` file.
   - **[UT Dining Dashboard](https://github.com/EthanL06/ut-dining-dashboard)**: To manage location information and other admin features through a web interface, clone the dashboard repository in a separate directory and use the same Supabase credentials in the `.env` file.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Copy the `.env-example` file to create a `.env` file:

   ```sh
   cp .env-example .env
   ```

   Update with your Supabase credentials and optionally add PostHog analytics:

   ```sh
    EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<supabase-url>
    EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<supabase-anon-key>
    EXPO_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_API_KEY=<posthog-api-key> # Optional - for analytics tracking
   ```

   > **Note**: The PostHog API key is optional. If not provided, analytics will be disabled. Analytics are automatically disabled in development mode.

5. **Create an Expo Account**

   Create an account at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev). Once you create the account, you can log in with:

   ```sh
   npx expo login
   ```

6. **Setup the Development Build**

   Since the app uses [react-native-mmkv](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv?tab=readme-ov-file) instead of `AsyncStorage`, you must run it with a development build rather than Expo Go.

   Run the following commands to build the development version:

   - **For iOS:**

     ```sh
     pnpm run ios
     ```

   - **For Android:**

     ```sh
     pnpm run android
     ```

   If you're developing for both platforms, run both commands.

   > **Note**: The build process may take some time. Please wait until it completes.

7. **Analytics Setup (OPTIONAL)**

   If you want to enable analytics tracking for your development environment:

   1. Create a free account at [PostHog](https://posthog.com/)
   2. Create a new project and copy your API key
   3. Add the API key to your `.env` file as `EXPO_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_API_KEY`

   > **Note**: Analytics are automatically disabled in development mode for privacy. Session replay and auto-capture will only work in production builds.

8. **Download to physical device (OPTIONAL)**

   If you want to test the app on a physical device, connect your device to your computer
   with a USB cable and run the following command:

   - **For iOS:**

   ```sh
   npx expo run:ios --device
   ```

   - **For Android:**

   ```sh
   npx expo run:android --device
   ```

   > **Note**: Make sure to enable USB debugging on your Android device. You can find the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).

   This will install the development build onto your device.

9. **Start the Development Server**

   ```sh
   pnpm run start
   ```

   Make sure that you are using `development build` instead of `Expo Go` when running the app. You can switch to the development build by pressing `s` in the terminal.

   **Tunneling for Physical Devices**

   If you're using a physical device on a public Wi-Fi network, use the following commands to tunnel the server to your device:

   ```sh
   pnpm run start --tunnel
   ```

   > Note: Tunneling may have limitations with Supabase connections. Using an emulator or development build is recommended for full functionality.

   **Debugging Drizzle with Drizzle Studio**

   While the development server is running, press `Shift + M` in the terminal and select `expo-drizzle-studio-plugin` to open Drizzle Studio in your browser. You can use this tool to inspect the SQLite database and troubleshoot any issues related to the local cache with SQLite and Drizzle ORM. Read more about Drizzle Studio [here](https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview).

10. **Launch Emulators**

To open the app on an emulator, press either of the following keys in the terminal:

- `i` to open on iOS simulator
- `a` to open on Android emulator

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Q: Is this app officially affiliated with UT Austin?**  
A: No, this is a student-created project that aims to improve the dining experience at UT Austin. While we use publicly available data from UT's University Housing and Dining, we are not officially affiliated with the university (yet 👀).

**Q: Where does the menu data come from?**  
A: The menu data is scraped daily from [UT Austin's official dining page](https://hf-foodpro.austin.utexas.edu/foodpro/location.aspx) using our [UT Dining Scraper](https://github.com/EthanL06/ut-dining-scraper).

**Q: How often is the menu data updated?**  
A: The menu data is updated every day at 1:00 AM CST (7:00 AM UTC) to ensure you have the most current information.

### Development

**Q: Do I need to run the scraper to test the app locally?**  
A: No, you can develop and test the app without running the scraper, but we highly recommend you do to be able to fully test all of the app's features. If you want to work with real menu data, you'll need to set up the [UT Dining Scraper](https://github.com/EthanL06/ut-dining-scraper) with your local Supabase instance.

**Q: What is local Supabase development and why do I need it?**  
A: Local Supabase development means running Supabase on your own computer instead of using a hosted service. This gives you:

- A completely isolated development environment
- Freedom to experiment without affecting production data
- No need for external credentials or API keys
- Faster development since you're working with a local database

The setup requires Docker Desktop and Supabase CLI, but once configured, it provides a full Supabase environment including database, authentication, and real-time features. Check the [Supabase Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development) docs for more details.

**Q: Why can't I use Expo Go?**  
A: The app uses [react-native-mmkv](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv) for storage, which requires native code. Expo Go doesn't support native modules, so you need to use a development build instead.

**Q: I'm getting SQLite errors, what should I do?**  
A: Make sure you're using a development build and not Expo Go. If the error persists, try:

1. Delete the app from your device/emulator
2. Rebuild using `pnpm run ios` or `pnpm run android`
3. If issues continue, check Drizzle Studio (press `Shift + M` in terminal) to inspect the database

**Q: How do I test admin features?**  
A: Admin features can be tested by:

1. Setting up the [UT Dining Dashboard](https://github.com/EthanL06/ut-dining-dashboard) locally
2. Using the same Supabase credentials from your local instance
3. Accessing the dashboard through your web browser
